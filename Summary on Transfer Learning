Transfer Learning

In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Neural Network from scratch because it is relatively rare to have large dataset.
Instead, it is common practice to pretrain a ConvNet on large dataset (such as ImageNet, which contain 1.2 million images for 1000 classes), and then use a ConvNet either as initialization or a fixed features of extractor. The three major Transfer Learning scenarios are as follows
